# my_first_analysis-AIRBNB

Airbnb business model is an aggregator business model just like Uber and OYO. They don't have a business 
model like hotels such as Hilton and Marriott. ... Airbnb acts as a platform for hosts and travellers. Hosts can put 
up their property for stay, and if someone wishes to stay there, the hosts get rent in exchange.

For attracting people Host prefers to use different words to describe different room types such as private room, entire home/apt, shared room.   Our experiment can help understand what the reason for the classification of such labels by data analysis could be. Our Project is to Investigate patterns and explanations in the context and convey the results in a dynamic and visual manner.

Problem Statement: The problem that this case study is dealing with predicts the location that a user is most likely to book for the first time. The accurate prediction helps to decrease the average time required to book by sharing more personalized recommendations and also in better forecasting of the demand. We use the browser’s session data as well as the user’s demographic information that is provided to us to create features that help in solving the problem.
 
Approach: To perform Exploratory Data Analysis on AIRBNB, we imported Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn to display the analysis of AIRBNB dataset in Graphical form through BarPlot, Histogram and Heatmap etc. Statistical graphics and other Data visualization methods are used to summarize their main characteristics of “AIRBNB dataset”.
